Title: Test 6

Group 12

Purpose: To see how each algorithm performs when a 20KB, a 10KB and a 12-byte .txt file arrive at the same time. It also ensures that RR works as expected.

How the test works: It reads in a 20KB, a 10KB and a 12-byte .txt file at the same time on port 38080.

Expected order of completion for SJF:
3, 2, 1

Expected order of completion for RR:
3, 2, 1

Expected order of completion for MLFB:

3, 2, 1
