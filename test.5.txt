Title: Test 5

Group 12

Purpose: To see how each algorithm performs when 5 .txt files of varying size arrive in order of size from greatest to least, however the largest two arrive at the same time, and the rest arrive 0.3 seconds later. It also ensures that SJF works as expected.

How the test works: It reads in two .txt files at the same time, and then three .txt files 0.3 seconds later on port 38080.

Expected order of completion for SJF:
2, 1, 5, 4, 3

Expected order of completion for RR:
2, 1, 4, 5, 3

Expected order of completion for MLFB:
2, 1, 4, 5, 3
